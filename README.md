	<h1>This website was created using free artificial intelligence known as ChatGPT. The following is the memorandum that was sent to your emails.</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>With artificial intelligence (AI) on the rise, the article aims at the usefulness of this technology in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The authors are looking at AI from its conceptualization to implementation, to see if it would be effective in increasing organizational creativity and performance. The idea being if AI technology is beneficial to organizational creativity and performance, and is financially beneficial, therefore it should be implemented.</p>

<h2>Key Questions</h2>
<p>Throughout the article, the authors look to answer two questions: Can a survey instrument be developed to measure an organization's AI capability? With said survey instrument, can an organization’s AI capability be fostered to show gains in terms of organizational creativity and performance?</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>When developing the survey instrument, the authors collected data to test the reliability and validity of the model. The validity was assessed using a group of experts who were asked to give their recommendations for which questions correspond to each construct. To further ensure its validity, a sample C-level technology managers were sent the instrument. When discussing the results of the data collected, the authors wrote, “...no significant differences were observed between responding and non-responding firms in terms of their industry, size-class, and age” (Mikalef 10).</p>

<h2>Statistical Techniques</h2>
<p>One of the statistical techniques used was confirmatory composite analysis. The aim is to help assess if it is viable to create the formative construct and identify any mistakes. To evaluate the model’s adequacy, the empirical correlation matrix and the model-implied correlation matrix are compared by examining the standardized root means square residual, unweighted least squares discrepancy, and geodesic discrepancy. This is put to the test when the authors were looking at, “the indicators [as they] provide empirical support to answer the question if the latent variables exist, or do the indicators form a higher-order construct” (Mikalef 12). Another statistical technique was used to analyze the data collected. The authors used Harman’s one-factor tests, which attempt to find any huge variances in the data. When the study variables were entered into a principal component factor analysis, it was discovered that a single construct did not explain the most of the variance.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The authors were able to develop and validate a conceptualization of an AI capability. This is through the combination of complementary resources found in humans, tangible items, and intangible items. This is split into eight resources. For tangibles: Basic Resources, Data, and Technology. For humans: Business and Technical Skills. For intangibles: Inter-departmental Coordination, Organizational Change Capacity, and Risk Proclivity. The eight resources the authors assert collectively form an AI capability. Per the authors, “[they] argue that eight types of complementary resources must be developed, and which jointly contribute to the emergence of an overall AI capability” (Mikalef 15).
